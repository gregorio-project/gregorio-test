# Project for Systematic Testing of Gregorio

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

## Repository Alignment

Each branch on this repository should correspond to the matching branch (i.e. the one with the same name) in the [main repository](https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio).  That is, all the tests should pass when run against that branch with TeXLive 2015.  Thus all new development in the main repository should create a corresponding branch here.  The exception to this is a branch which should not break any existing test and requires no new tests.  In this instance, it's acceptable to simply indicate that all tests on the develop (or master) branch here should pass.

### TeXLive 2014

When testing with TeXLive 2014 the following tests are known to fail due to differences between it and TeXLive 2015:
  -`tex-output/clef-change/clef-change.tex`


## Running the test suite

Use `./gregorio-test.sh` to run the full test suite with default options.
Pass the name(s) of desired tests to run those tests specifically.  Pass the
`-h` option to get a summary of available options.

`gregorio-test.sh` will read a `gregorio-test.rc` file, if it exists, to set
up some features such as color.  Please read the `gregorio-test.sh` file
itself for more information.  See `example.gregorio-test.rc` for an example.

## Test Types

This project provides a harness for repeatable testing of Gregorio.
Tests should be placed in the tests directory, within the proper
subdirectory depending on type.  The following types are supported:

#### gabc-gtex

This test runs gregorio against each gabc file in this directory to
produce a GregorioTeX file and compares it with an expected output file.

Requirements:

- Every gabc file must have a corresponding "expected" tex file.

Notes:

The first two lines are stripped from the "expected" tex file as well as
from the file produced by running gregorio during the test before the
comparison.

#### gabc-dump

This test runs gregorio against each gabc file in this directory to
produce an text dump file and compares it with an expected output file.

Requirements:

- Every gabc file must have a corresponding "expected" dump file.

#### gabc-output

This test creates a simple TeX driver file which invokes `\includescore`
on each gabc file in this directory in order to compile it and produce a
PDF, which is then compared with an expected PDF file.

Requirements:

- Every gabc file must have a corresponding "expected" PDF file.

Notes:

The PDFs are compared by first converting the pages to PNG files with
imagemagick's convert and then compared using imagemagick's compare and
the AE metric.

#### tex-output

This test runs lualatex on every tex file in this directory in order to
compile it and produce a PDF, which is then compared with an expected
PDF file.  It is recommended, due to the nature of this test, that each
test be in a separate subdirectory.  Unless necessary for a particular
test, use the provided Alegreya fonts for rendering.

Requirements:

- Every tex file must have a corresponding "expected" PDF file.
- All other files needed by the tex file (i.e., gabc files) must also
  be included.
- Use of the provided Alegreya fonts is recommended.

Notes:

The PDFs are compared by first converting the pages to PNG files with
imagemagick's convert and then compared using imagemagick's compare and
the AE metric.

#### plain-tex

The plain TeX version of `tex-output`.  This test runs luatex on every
tex file in this directory in order to compile it and produce a PDF,
which is then compared with an expected PDF file.  It is recommended,
due to the nature of this test, that each test be in a separate
subdirectory.  Unless necessary for a particular test, use the provided
Alegreya fonts for rendering.

Requirements:

- Every tex file must have a corresponding "expected" PDF file.
- All other files needed by the tex file (i.e., gabc files) must also
  be included.
- Use of the provided Alegreya fonts is recommended.

Notes:

The PDFs are compared by first converting the pages to PNG files with
imagemagick's convert and then compared using imagemagick's compare and
the AE metric.

## Creating "Expected" Files

For a new test:

1. Run `./gregorio-test.sh -n {subdirectory/under/tests}`
2. Run `./gregorio-test.sh -a {subdirectory/under/tests}`

For an existing test, where the new output is deemed to be correct.

1. Run `./gregorio-test.sh -a {subdirectory/under/tests}`

# Software Requirements

- Bash
- Imagemagick
- Gregorio
- TeX Live

# Developer Notes

Each kind of test must have seven functions defined in `harness.sh`, prefixed
by a common prefix:

- find
- test
- accept
- view\_log
- view\_diff
- view\_expected
- view\_output

Be sure to pass the prefix to the register function after declaring the new
functions.

All tests contributed must be licensed under GPLv3 with the "or later"
option.

Put comments in test cases to describe what they test.  They are
free-form for now, but start the comment with `%issue:` to give the
GitHub issue number and with `%notes:` to summarize the test case.
Such magic comments may be harvested in the future.
